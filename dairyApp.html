            <div class="paraHeading"><h3>Overview</h3></div>
            <div class="paraBody"><p>"Dairy" is a journaling app that aims to reflect users' tasks on physical journals. It combines both a diary (reflective) and a planner (future-planning) in the app, while using appropriate technology for improving the usability. The app was designed using the Agile Methodology, which included iterative development and constant feedback from users.

            <div class="paraHeading"><h3>The Challenge</h3></div>
            <div class="paraBody"><p>For my final semester, I worked individually for 12 weeks. I wanted to exercise my ability to practise the agile process on my own, while merging it with something I was interested in.</p></div>
        </div>

            <div class="paras">
                <div class="paraHeading"><h3>Initial Research</h3></div>
                <div class="paraBody"><p>
                Time is important, and one way for people to organise their time in an efficient way is to use diaries. Writing can also be therapeutic for people, and while it can help people be organised, it can keep their goals on track, and it can help the brain regulate emotions too. <br><br>

                With physical planners, people also seem to like that it leads them away from digital screens. I want to be able to explore ways to allow something physical be digital, using users’ needs and requirements. I am aware that there are existing planner applications that aren’t seamless to users. One of the reasons as to why it may not me usable, is that it may not be designed with the users tasks and goals in mind. <br><br>

                There are few disadvantages of using physical planners, such as having to remember to bring a physical book around, needing to buy new planners when the pages run out, having no back-up and the divide from the digital integration. Hopefully designing a user-centred application would allow the participants to think about using a different way to use planners with efficiency and with the help of technology.<br><br>
                I really wanted to expand my knowledge and grow my empathy with potential target users, so I tried to find as much information as I could. I wanted to limit the amount of assumptions I was going to make, and by doing a lot of documentation, I felt like it helped me somewhat tone down the assumptions.

                    <p>I set up my survey on Google Forms to allow me to gather insights and thoughts from a group of people. I already knew the participants, so I knew that they weren’t going to be digital diary users, but I still had a journey for that route.</p></div>

                    <p>To summarise, I found that 100% of the participants use books as planners, and 100% of the participants use the journals to record thoughts, compared to 80% who use it to organise time. I thought this was interesting as it would inform me of the interface metaphors I could use. 100% thought that personalisation is important with their diaries. <br><br> I also gathered the adjectives the participants used to describe themselves to help me create personas, and inform me of some design decisions. 80% of the participants use their phones, and from this, I will decide to use mobiles phones as the medium for my project. <br><br>With the adjectives that my participants have given me, and I decided to group words together to help inform the design of my app, in terms of icons/animations, body copy and the layout. I also noted down the favourite things that people had about their diaries, their dislikes, and the other uses. </p>

                        <p>I researched some existing mobile applications to see what had already been done, what the patterns are, and where I could situate my project.

I also looked at review sites, youtube videos, and reviews on the app store to gather what people thought about the apps that they use.<br><br>

                        I found that these apps were basically split into three categories: reflection apps (diaries), organisers (planners) and tracker apps.

                    <p class="indentPara">
                    The product should take entries whether it be notes/plans and track users’ entries over time to give them trends/patterns to help them in the future – organise time/predict moods/remember notes etc.</p>
                <p>Data Requirements:</p>
                    <p class="indentPara">
                   Geolocation data (time/date/location/weather) for tracking purposes. Written entries from the user, and some ranking entries (in terms of mood). Data needs to be kept secure and will not be deleted unless the user wishes to delete any information.</p>
                <p>Environmental Requirements:</p>
                    <p class="indentPara">
                    Users will be using this app most likely in short bursts during the day (and night), rather than using it for longer duration per use, so the app will need to allow to be opened and closed without disrupting the information/flow of the app. Data will be shared to other people if the user chooses to share their information with other people (in the form of reminders, or sharing memories). It will also be designed for the mobile phone thus some patterns from mobile phone pattern library will need accounted.</p>
                <p>User characteristics:</p>
                    <p class="indentPara">
                    18-25 year olds who are technologically savvy, and who primarily use print diaries.</p>
                <p>Usability Goals:</p>
                    <p class="indentPara">
                    The app will need to be effective – in terms of how good this app is at doing what it’s supposed to do. This would primarily the tracking trends feature. The app will also need to be efficient, as it is taking something print and using technology to optimise features that something print is unable to do. The app should also be easy to learn and easy to remember how to use. The users may not use this app daily, and hopefully will remember how to use the app without needing a tutorial.</p>
                <p>User Experience Goals: </p>
                    <p class="indentPara">
                    The app will need to be motivating, emotionally fulfilling and helpful for the users. The goal is for them to be organised – mentally, emotionally and physically.</p>

                        <p>I then wrote quick scenario stories to help bridge the gap between the personas and the app I will design. Each story makes use of their different personalities. This is so that the app will cater to the slightly different people, and will therefore have different tasks/features to give more dimensions to the app. <br><br>
                        I created the scenario maps in conjunction to these stories. Doing the maps helped me think about each task for the user to get to their goal. I was able to think about the steps, questions/problems that arise and some ideas to fix those problems.

                            <p>Extending the scenario maps, I thought of the main tasks/features that each persona would use in the app. I decided to use all of the personas, instead of just choosing one, as I felt like it would give me different dimensions to the application. It’s also a great exercise for me because I will need to empathise with three different characters, and thinking about what’s important for each persona. Doing this also allows me to pin point pain areas to cater to the different parts of the app which may be frustrating or least desirable for users to use.

                <br><br>There is a lot of engagement between the client and the designer, and can be used for short-term projects with no clear requirements at the start. I wanted to explore designing a user-centred system, which allows me to test with users often and analyse the results to develop the application. The decisions were informed by the research at the start, and the feedback form the constant usability tests.
                <br><br>
                The main stages of the process are: research, design, prototype (this includes testing: and in the process there were 2 Heuristic Tests at the start and the end of the project, and 5 usability tests) and evaluation. Once a round is done, the cycle continues.

                        I also set up my design system, ready to give participants a more real and tactile feeling when going through the prototype of the application. the colours and textures is based on the book cover of “Pippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren (1950)”. Basing a colour system on a physical book allows something digital to have a connection to something physical.

                        I also had been thinking about a name for my app, and from research, I noticed that a lot of app names are an extension of what they do (eg diaro, momento, journey, etc) and I wanted to do the same, as well as reflect the words from above, thus choosing dairy! People always mix up diary and dairy and I thought that it would be funny and quirky to play on this. For branding, I then wrote dairy using dairy products to give an organic fluid and round form.

                        It also made me think about the long time users and the kind of things that would make their tasks and actions more efficient. According to Nielsen, a usable system must have accelarators for experienced users to allow them to carry their tasks in an efficient manner.
