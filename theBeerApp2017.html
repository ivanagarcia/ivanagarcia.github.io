            <div class="paraBody"><p>The beer app is a mobile application that lets a user find breweries based on their location. The application also helps them connect with beer and friends.</p></div>

            <div class="paraHeading"><h3>The Challenge</h3></div>
            <div class="paraBody"><p>For the fall semester of 2017, my Usability and Design class got split into groups to design an application that centred around alcohol. My group consisted of Chris and Matt (both software developers) and I, (a designer). </p></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="paras">
            <div class="paraHeading"><h3>Research</h3></div>
            <div class="paraBody"><p>We needed to find places of need within the alcohol culture, otherwise, what would the point of our proposed application be? We initially did some research into some quick statistics about alcohol, and found that the craft beer industry is growing. In 2012, the craft beer market made up 10% of all beers sold, in 2015, that number increased to 19%. The trend continued, and in 2016, the number jumped to 21.9% (Snider).<br>

Craft beer is a major part of beer sales, and there are plenty of opportunities for breweries to be a part of the market. Brand new breweries continue to pop up all over the world, and in 2016 alone, 826 new breweries opened, and only 97 were closed (Snider).<br>

Our team proposed that this application would organise information about beers and breweries in an organised manner, to be a helpful and efficient tool.</p></div>

From Pierre and Herz, we gathered that:</p></div>

            <div class="paraBody"><p>We initially noted down main goals that a user may have, and what kind of tasks they could complete with this application.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users should be able to click on the application on their mobile phones and be able to input their location (or allow location services for the app to get their location automatically) and get information for the breweries and events around the user, and to be able to filter through those.</li>
                    <li>Users should also be able to search for breweries using address search.</li>
                    <li>Users should also be able to view featured beers (including seasonal beers) and breweries - which can be accessed through another tab (in a ‘discover’ tab).</li>
                    <li>Users should also be able to view events, not only nearby them, but in a greater radius by setting a filter such as - Within 20/50/100/etc miles of their current location.</li>
                    <li>There will be a social network aspect in which each user will have a profile in which they can keep track of the craft beers they have tried and the breweries they have visited. They can keep track of their ‘favourites’ by a simple like button and users can follow other users to find more craft beers or breweries.

            <div class="paraHeading"><h3>Design Inspiration</h3></div>
            <div class="paraBody"><p>Because most of the craft beer consumers lie in the millennial generation, we wanted to use inspiration from popular current applications that already cater to our target audience. Using the successful aspects of their application design, we will base our own designs from their usable interface. Using existing patterns from other applications will help us design our own applications, as users will bring their current mental models and will easily adjust into our own application.</p>

            <p>The usability of an application is determined by how efficient it is to use (ie how learnable and memorable it is.) The quicker a user is able to learn how to use an application, the quicker they are able to complete a task. The more memorable the functions of an application are, the quicker the user is able to complete a task.
            </p>
            <p>We looked at a few popular applications that  millennials use.</p></div>

            <div class="paraBody"><p>Customer Journey maps help illustrate what a user might think and feel as they are using a product. This helps bridge between a customer's thoughts and the application's interface and software. This helps us figure out what screens we really need and what kind of tasks that could be done on these screens.<br>
                We figured out the main tasks that can be done using our app, and made customer journey maps to correspond to those. We based this off "Tom – The Beer Enthusiast."</p></div>
