            <div class="paraBody"><p>For the fall semester of 2017, my Usability and Design class got split into groups to design an application that centred around alcohol. My group consisted of Chris and Matt (both software developers) and I, (a designer). </p></div>

            <div class="paraBody"><p>We needed to find places of need within the alcohol culture, otherwise, what would the point of our proposed application be? We initially did some research into some quick statistics about alcohol, and found that the craft beer industry is growing. In 2012, the craft beer market made up 10% of all beers sold, in 2015, that number increased to 19%. The trend continued, and in 2016, the number jumped to 21.9% (Snider).<br><br>

Craft beer is a major part of beer sales, and there are plenty of opportunities for breweries to be a part of the market. Brand new breweries continue to pop up all over the world, and in 2016 alone, 826 new breweries opened, and only 97 were closed (Snider).<br><br>

Our team proposed that this application would organise information about beers and breweries in an organised manner, to be a helpful and efficient tool.</p></div>

                    <li>Users should also be able to search for breweries using address search.</li>
                    <li>Users should also be able to view featured beers (including seasonal beers) and breweries - which can be accessed through another tab (in a ‘discover’ tab).</li>
                    <li>Users should also be able to view events, not only nearby them, but in a greater radius by setting a filter such as - Within 20-50-100 etc miles of their current location.</li>
                    <li>There will be a social network aspect in which each user will have a profile in which they can keep track of the craft beers they have tried and the breweries they have visited. They can keep track of their ‘favourites’ by a simple like button and users can follow other users to find more craft beers or breweries.

Using the successful aspects of their application design, we based our own designs from their usable interface. Using existing patterns from other applications helped us design our own applications, as users will bring their current mental models and will easily adjust into our own application.<br><br></p>

            <p>The usability of an application is determined by how efficient it is to use (ie how learnable and memorable it is.) The quicker a user is able to learn how to use an application, the quicker they are able to complete a task. The more memorable the functions of an application are, the quicker the user is able to complete a task.

                <p class="indentPara">
            Interface metaphors allow users to find a connection between our conceptual model and what they are familiar to (Preece). In this application, we have added a search bar (using a magnifying glass icon), which is already a familiar metaphor that our users can easily understand. The map is also based on real life maps - there are directions, roads, and the main thing (or things) the user is looking for. Because our target audience is well versed with technology, it would be unnecessary for us to explicitly explain the different functions that can be completed with some aspects of the app (eg, zooming in and out of the map, and moving the map around on screen.) Using the map as an interface metaphor can help us with structuring our application. We used the typical mapping conventions to help inform us about what kind of information to display on the interface.</p>
            
            <p class="paraBold">Interface Type</p>
                <p class="indentPara">
            The app that we designed is a mobile-based application, and with this, comes with some guidelines and principles which we need to take in account for due to the smaller screen size and the environment that the user might be in while using the application (Preece). For example, making sure that the buttons are big enough for the user to tap to without having difficulty. Another aspect that Preece discusses is the idea that people resort to mobile phones when they need up to date information, and our application provides up to date information about beer to our users.</p>
                
            <p class="paraBold">Communication Type</p>
                <p class="indentPara">
            This application involves a co-presence type of communication. This involves having awareness of what everyone else is doing, and making everyone aware of what you’re doing (Preece). Our application allows users to see their friend’s posts, and also make their own posts. It also keeps track of the beer that the user has tried, and their favorite beer, which they can make public on their profile.</p>

Lingaard proposes that improving an application through user testing can also improve it. Other things such as observation and interviews can also help with improving an application’s development, which won’t necessarily be seen through user testing or even heuristic evaluations. Because of this, we proposed that doing a heuristic evaluation for our own application will get rid of the main and obvious errors, and after completing that, we can get real users to test our products to fine tune what to improve upon.<br><br>
              We came up with our own set of heuristics, which were based from Nielsen’s and Gomez’:

We also had them do a consent form to give us permission to use their data.</p>

                        <p class="indentPara2">Chunking information into their own pages to be more logical, and to be more memorable for the user, as it also reduces memory load, so the user will not be overwhelmed with what is on the screen (Lidwell).<br><br>
                    Using Hick’s law helped us narrow down the amount of information shown on the page. Hick’s Law, simply, discusses how the time it takes for a user to complete a task increases with the number of available options or stimuli (Nikolov).
                     <br><br>       
                    According to Soegaard, the landing page is the first glimpse the user will see, and with our app, the main beer page acts as the landing page for that particular feature, and it is “particularly important to minimize the choices on there.” There are ways to do this, like categorizing choice (much like chunking) where we categorize lists logically (Soegaard) and presenting it in such a way that won’t look cluttered.<br><br>
                    According to Nielsen, having user control and freedom in an interface is a principle for interaction design. We chose to implement an ‘Are you sure?’ dialog for the user to check if they really wish to clear the filters. Sometimes, users make mistakes, and will need a clearly marked “emergency exit” to go back to their previous state (Nielsen).

                    <p class="indentPara2">We primarily changed the aesthetic and location of the ‘save’ button, in hopes to attract the user and therefore move on quickly to complete their task in a timely manner. We hoped that the design change is enough for the participant to know what to do next (which is to tap on the save button), and where to look to complete the task of saving the changes made on their profile. 
                    <br>We planned to test this task again and we planned to also observe the user, watching their actions and listening to what they say, to get an idea of what their thoughts are. We planned to also ask the participants for their opinions on the task (using the post-evaluation test), and we timed the users with how long they complete this task:</p>

                    <p class="indentPara2">We primarily grouped the different categories into their own lists, and the user is able to tap on different lists, which will take them to separate pages full of results, which they can then filter through, using the filtering feature. <br>In chunking the categories into separate pages, we hope that the user does not feel overwhelmed or lost with the amount of information on the page, and therefore, will be able to carry on with their tasks. To get an idea of what their thoughts are, we planned to listen to what they say vocally, and what they do while interacting with the interface. We planned to ask them for their opinions on the interface using an updated post-evaluation form.</p>

                <p class="indentPara2">We also wanted to test the usability of the filter feature, in terms of its on and off states for some buttons. Our filtering feature, by default, has the states ON for the availability, and we planned to ask the user to find a beer that is available all year round, using the search feature. We planned to observe what they do, and ask them for their thoughts. We planned to also ask the user how they know which states are on and which are off in the post-evaluation test.</p>
                <p class="indentPara">
                Because of the changes to our tests, we needed to change the content of our post-evaluation form to ask for more specific things to do with the tasks outlined above.

                        We also had tested some users over the internet. We used Skype to share screens, so we could see what the user was doing, and we had the microphone and camera set up so we could hear and see them too.

                        From our first prototype and our first evaluation, we found that users found two tasks more challenging than the rest. We chose to focus on these tasks to improve upon, and therefore test new users on. The tasks that we asked users to do were similar to the first prototype lab (especially for the profile task, since we didn’t do many changes – we just wanted to test if the time taken to complete this task would be significantly lessen). <br>However, for the beer task, we did change quite a bit, so the tasks we got the user to complete were catered to the changes.

                        <br>We had changed our form, since our first post-questionnaire had questions about the different features of the application, and other things like the design of the icons. We got rid of some of those questions because a) we didn’t want our users to be frustrated due to the endless questions and b) the users from the first prototype lab responded well to the icons designed.

                Beer Task: </p>
                    <p class="indentPara2">
                        Using our past research, we decided to make the filtering feature more obvious to help the user move along the interface in a quick manner. We haven't yet finalised what exactly we plan to do, but this is a rough look of the proposed change:</p>

                <p>Satisfaction:</p>
                <p class="indentPara">
                Another important aspect of usable interfaces is how satisfied a user feels when they are using an application. In our post-evaluation survey, we asked what the users would rather use compared to our application:</p>

                    <p class="indentPara">
                There were some users that were vocal when answering the forms, and overall, we had good and positive feedback. We can see that a lot of our users still prefer to go to their friends and family for their opinions on beers and bars. Our application lacks conversation, and perhaps this is what people want when they go to other people for their opinion on alcohol and places.<br><br></p>
