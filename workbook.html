                <h3>Week 11: 11/11/17</h3>
                <h4>Proposal:</h4>
                <p>A dress up game with mty dog, Cinnamon as the main character. The design style will be illustrative, and doodle-like with different brush patterns. </p>
                <br>
                <p>I will need to create my own art, using photoshop and a variety of brushes that I have made using scanned in elements. I hope to finish this project by the deadline that the professor has set.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I will start off with researching existing dress up games to see similar patterns, and I will research existing art, for which I'd like to model my own art after.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I will be using Photoshop for the art, inDesign to quickly wireframe, and Brackets for coding.</p>
                <br>
                <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aLI509XtQqSlrJXBIb_geWYAT1TbEZLN/view?usp=sharing">Link to my presentation</a></p>
                <br>
                
                <h4>Wireframe:</h4>
                <img class="entry" src="images/workbook/week11/week11-1.png"/>
                <p>On the left, it shows the default, with nothing chosen. On the right shoes an outfit picked out for cinnamon. The colour scheme uses a similar one to my website. The icon style also uses a similar aesthetic to my website. Once an item is selected, there will be a red border that is shown to give the user visibility as to what they’ve clicked on. There is a cross so they could hide the particular item. There is also a big reset button at the bottom so the user could restart the dress up game.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h4>Design comps:</h4>
                <p>These are all the accessories and clothing that I will be using for this game. These are in PNG format, which supports transparent backgrounds. I used photoshop and an assortment of brushes to give the collage/doodle look:</p>
                <img class="entry" src="images/workbook/week11/week11-2.png"/>
                <br><br>
   
                <p>Here are all the thumbnails that I will be using for the game. These will act as buttons for the user to click on:</p>
                <img class="entry" src="images/workbook/week11/week11-3.png"/>
                <br><br>
                
                <p>Here are the icons and buttons that will be used in the game:</p>
                <img class="entry" src="images/workbook/week11/week11-4.png"/>
                <br><br>
                
                <h4>Tech Overview:</h4>
                <p>I will be using jQuery, and basically layer all the images on top of each other, and by default have them ‘off.’ Once the user taps on an accessory or clothing, it will turn the accessory/clothing ‘on.’ </p>
                <br>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="weekly">
                <h3>Week 10: 11/4/17</h3>
                <h4>Concept:</h4>
                <p>A dress up game, but with my dog, Cinnamon as the character the user is dressing up.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h4>Color:</h4>
                <p>I wanted something youthful, vibrant and fun, but at the same time, I want it with softer tones to suit the doodle/drawn style I am after. Possible colours include:</p>
                <img class="entry" src="images/workbook/week10/color.png"/>
                <br>
                
                <h4>Typography:</h4>
                <p>For the name of the game ‘Cinnamon’s closet’ I am planning to use my own handwriting, stylized to suit the drawn aesthetic of the game. Here are some sketches:
                </p>
                <img class="entry" src="images/workbook/week10/type-handwritten.png"/>
                <br>
                <p>For the body text of the game, if any, I will use the typeface Montserrat, because I feel like the circular san-serif typography looks more modern and youthful compared to a serif font.
                </p>
                <img class="entry" src="images/workbook/week10/montserrat.png"/>
                <br>
                
                <h4>Layout/Grid:</h4>
                <p>I looked at existing dress up games to get an idea of the layout, colour and content. Here are some inspiration.
                </p>
                <img class="entry" src="images/workbook/week10/game-moodboard.png"/>
                <br>
                <p>My grid is roughly based off a 12-column layout grid:
                </p>
                <img class="entry" src="images/workbook/week10/layout.png"/>
                <br>
                
                <h4>Photography/Illustration:</h4>
                <p>I wanted a doodle/drawn aesthetic to the game, which I know will be difficult to pull off, especially if I will draw things on the computer. Here are some inspiration:
                </p>
                <img class="entry" src="images/workbook/week10/moodboard-art.png"/>
                <br>
                <p>Quick sketches of potential content for accessories and clothing, and the look of Cinnamon.
                </p>
                <img class="entry" src="images/workbook/week10/art.png"/>
                <br>
                
                <h4>Tech features:</h4>
                <p>I found some pens from codepen that I can base my code from, for example: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://codepen.io/kristen3119/full/kkkdBr" class="bullet"> "Dress-up Game"</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://codepen.io/giuliacardieri/pen/pRWVGY?q=dress+up&limit=all&type=type-pens" class="bullet"> "Potato Maker - Css Illustrations Only"</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://codepen.io/giuliacardieri/pen/YNJBMO?q=dress+up&limit=all&type=type-pens" class="bullet"> "Dinokiki Maker - SVG only"</a></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Javascript is used, with PNG images layered on top of each other. Once a button is clicked, the accessory, or clothing item is revealed.</p>
